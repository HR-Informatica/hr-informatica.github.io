### Requirements elication and analysis process
#### Techniques
- **Interviews:**
    - Most commonly used technique.
    - Basic steps:
        - Selecting interviewees
            - Based on information needs
            - Best to get different perspectives
        - Designing interview questions.
            - Try Closed, open and probing questions
        - Preparing for the interview
            - General plan
            - Schedule
            - Confirm
        - Conducting the interview
            - Record everything (notes or recording)
            - Choose a questioning method:
                - Structured, goal is clear and information is expected.
                - Unstructured, create a discussion and get your information from that discussion.
        - Post-interview follow-up
            - Polish the notes or create them from the recording.
            - Prepare a report and check it with the interviewee.
            - Find gaps and new questions.
- **JAD (Joint Application Development):**
    - This is a structured group process focused on collecting and clarifying requirements
    - Involves various stakeholders.
        - Facilitator
            - Trained in this technique.
            - Sets agenda en guides the group.
            - Makes sure that everyone is aware of the decisions.
            - Keep session on track.
            - Stays neutral and helps resolve issues.
            - Records the content (recording or notes).
        - Users and managers from the bussiness with detailed knowledge about the issue.
- **Questionnaires:**
    - Set of questions sent to a large number of people.
    - Select participants using samples of the population
    - Create questkions that are easy to understand but that give a lot of information.
- **Document analysis:**
    - Study of existing material describing the system.
    - Forms, reports, policy manuals, organization charts describe the formal system.
    - Look for the informal system in user additions to forms/report and unused form/report elements.
    - User changes to existing forms/reports or non-use of existing forms/reports suggest the system needs modification.
- **Observation**
    - Watch how processes are being performed now.
    - Users often don't recall everything they do.
    - Check the validity of the information via other ways.
    - Behavior of people can change when you watch them.
    - Do not disturb the people you are watching.

#### Ethnography
- A scientist spend some time observing and analysing how people are working.
- The people don't explain what they are doing.
- Other factors, such as social and organisational factors can also be observed.
- In ethnographic studies scientists have seen that the work is usually richer and more compley than that simple models would suggest.

### Good requirements
- Unambiguous
    - There should be only one interpretation of the requirement.
    - It has to be easy to understand.
- Concise
    - Should be stated in short, specific and action-oriented language.
- Finite
    - Should not be stated in an open-ended manner.
- Measurable
    - Specific measurable limits should be stated.
- Feasible
    - Everything should be available, like tools, personnel etc.
- Testable
    - There should have to be a way to test the requirements
- Traceable
    - A requirement implemted should be traceble to where it was in the Software Requirements Specification.
